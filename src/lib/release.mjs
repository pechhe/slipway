 * artifacts and any half-built Specs (warned about, never refused). With `confirm`, the candidate commit id a human approved, it checks
 * that exact commit out on its own, runs `requiredReleaseVerification`, builds the
 * release merge, refuses unless its tree is the verified tree, and publishes it.
 * Concurrent confirms coalesce: see `holdReleaseSlot`.
