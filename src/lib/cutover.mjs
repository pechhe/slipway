 *
 * Order: refuse while anything holds or is about to hold the old state; move the
 * state directory and mode file (rename, or copy-verify-delete across devices);
 * replace the installed `peach-workspace` CLI and library with refusing stubs;
 * write the marker last. Until the marker exists every slipway state accessor
 * refuses (`workspace-paths.mjs`), so no slipway process starts on the new store
 * mid-move. Existing workspaces stay where they are (`~/.pi/workspaces`); their
