/**
 * The landing tool's one public entry (`@pechhe/slipway`). Every consumer
 * outside this directory imports only from here: the desktop through its pinned
 * tag, the Pi launcher and jj-workspace extension (until `slipway cutover`,
 * through the `~/.pi/agent/lib/peach-workspace.mjs` shim). The closure behind it
 * is self-contained and acyclic; `bun run check` enforces both, and that nothing
 * else imports a module here directly.
